I spend quite some time the last few weeks moving some digital resources. The older I get, the more paranoid I get too, which leads to some very interesting developments. One of the things I wanted to get rid of, was dynamic websites. They need to be updated, not only content wise, but also the frameworks and software to avoid vulnerabilities and losing data.

# Blog
I moved my blog! From [Wordpress](https://www.wordpress.org) to a static website hosted on [Github Pages](thhps://www.github.io) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
Nobody knows for how long I am going use Github for hosting the website, but I like the idea of using [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) as a markdown-superset. I even find it really convenient using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to create, modify and update my pages and posts.

I even added a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate to my blog, which was quite simple after setting up a sub-domain for it.

# www.feutl.com
After the wordpress site wasn't necessary any more, I converted the main (www) domain to a static site as well. [world4you](https://www.world4you.com/en/index.html), my hoster right now, also offers a simple option to get [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates, which just needs to be enabled.

# Nextcloud
One of the next things I am working on.

I have used [Resilio Sync](https://www.resilio.com/individuals/) for quite some time already. All private data, especially pictures made with mobile phones, gets synced between devices using it. I am considering myself a heavy user with up to 9 devices and 30 shares syncing over multiple devices to multiple destinations. This all works great, but it lacks some features, like a simple way to share files/folders with others or even give someone access to the synced folders to work with them (or few the pictures made). Therefor I am going to migrate parts of it to [Nextcloud](https://www.nextcloud.com.).

I found an old netbook in the basement which fits my needs, for now. After having everything setup, I am impressed how stable and reliable it is, even on such a small and "underpowered" hardware.

Using a seperate sub-domain also SSL with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) wasn't an issue at all.

# Mail System
This is something I need to get done until the end of 2018 as well. I am still using legacy Google Apps. This is something I really regret, moving to Google Apps while I was at the university 15 years ago. Past then, it was a great idea, but today it feels just wrong.
