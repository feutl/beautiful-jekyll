Sometimes the Command Line can get very useful - therefor it is good to know which parameters can be used. NextGen Admin, formerly known as NG Admin, has some nice CLI options.

```cmd
-c:SERVER:USER:PASSWORD:IsMC:MODULE
   SERVER = Server addrese or host name
   USER = User name
   PASSWORD = password
   IsMC = Connect to a mc/cc
   MODULE = Numeric tab index

-user=foo -pwd=bar -server=1.2.3.4 -box</pre>
```
