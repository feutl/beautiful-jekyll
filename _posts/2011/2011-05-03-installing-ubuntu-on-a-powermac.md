After a lot of testing and playing around with my PowerMac (which I do not own any more) I found out that Ubuntu 10.10 is working without any problems out of the box. That was the best solution for first time installation and then I upgraded to the newest version. But before I came to this conclusion I collected a few helpful links which I want to share
