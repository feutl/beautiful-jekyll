Now I describe the "new" and safer method to upgrade your Orinoco Silver Card using Alchemy.

## Convert your ORiNOCO Silver card to Gold, and enable 128-bit WEP

It's really simple and only needs some tiny steps:

1.  Download Alchemy V1.01
2.  Open DOS box or command prompt
3.  Start Alchemy and choose your card
4.  Follow the instructions
5.  After a successful conversion run the firmware updater

Should be run without problems using Win98 and WinXP. 

> WARNING: THIS PROGRAM WRITES TO THE NVRAM OF YOUR CARD. WHILE IT IS UNLIKELY THAT ANY DAMAGE MAY BE DONE, THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT YOUR CARD MAY BE RENDERED UNUSABLE IF SOMETHING GOES AWRY SUCH AS YOUR SYSTEM CRASHING WHILE IT UPDATES YOUR CARD. USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK; I WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE IF YOUR CARD IS DAMAGED BY IT.
